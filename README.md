# MeetHomie - An Intuitive Scheduling App

The inspiration behind developing this scheduling app stemmed from the noticeable inefficiencies and limitations present in existing scheduling solutions. Many of these applications often require cumbersome steps to simply set up a meeting, lack intuitive interfaces, or do not offer flexible scheduling options that cater to the varying availability and preferences of all participants.

This scheduling app addresses these problems by:

- **Simplifying User Authentication**: Users can create an account with just their email, making the entry barrier as low as possible.
- **Enhanced Flexibility in Scheduling**: This platform allows the host to propose multiple time slots and lets the invitees indicate their availability preferences as high, medium, or low. This feature ensures that the final meeting time accommodates the preferences of all participants as much as possible, significantly reducing scheduling conflicts.
- **Centralized and Intuitive Dashboard**: All scheduled meetings are displayed on a calendar view, providing a holistic and easy-to-navigate overview. Users can manage, accept, and finalize invitations effortlessly from a single page.
- **Improved Communication**: The ability to leave notes for each meeting invites—ranging from logistical details to personal messages—facilitates better communication and personalization.

These features collectively provide a more user-friendly, efficient, and flexible scheduling experience, addressing the shortcomings of existing tools and enhancing user satisfaction.
